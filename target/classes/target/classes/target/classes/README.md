# aMazeGame
A game that randomly generates a maze using different maze generation algorithms that the user needs to solve 

# Concepts Used
Designing a maze requires the use of different algorithms 
and data structures inorder to make the algorithm work

## Algorithms 

### Depth first search 
Is used for graph traversing and searching of graphs.It starts 
at any selected point and checks as far as it can along the
selected point. When its reaches an end it backtracks to find
a previously visited point that still has available neighbors.

Data structures used: Stacks and ArrayLists

Notes: Tends to make loong corridors in mazes.
